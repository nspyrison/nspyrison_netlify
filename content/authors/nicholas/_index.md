I am a PhD candidate at Monash University, Melbourne Australia where I study multivariate data visualization, dimension reduction, and nonlinear model interpretability. I have recently submitted my thesis [_Interactive and dynamic visualization of high-dimensional data_](https://nspyrison.github.io/thesis_ns/). I am the author of the R packages [__spinifex__](https://nspyrison.github.io/spinifex/) and [__cheem__](https://nspyrison.github.io/cheem/).

| Package | CRAN | Pkgdown | Shiny app | GitHub |

I am grateful to be studying with the [NUMBATS](https://numbat.space/) and [Immersive Analytics](https://ialab.it.monash.edu/). My PhD research is in collaboration with 
[Professor Dianne Cook](http://www.dicook.org/) and [Professor Kim Marriott](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/kimbal-marriott).

I have been deepening my appreciation for coffee during my time in Australia. I love dogs and enjoy a good bike ride, comedy, and board games.
