I am studying multivariate data visulizations as PhD candidate at Monash University, Melbourne Austalia. I am the author of the R package [{spinifex}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spinifex/index.html), which facilitates 'manual' data visualization tours, _ie._ animations of linear projections orthogonally interpolating as the contribution of a single variable is controled. The package also consumes `{tourr}` tour paths extending the graphics they can be rendered with.

I am grateful to be studying with the [NUMBATS](https://numbat.space/) and [Immersive Analytics](https://ialab.it.monash.edu/). My PhD reseach is in collaboration with 
[Professor Dianne Cook](http://www.dicook.org/) and [Professor Kim Marriott](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/kimbal-marriott)

I have been deepening my appreciation for coffee during my time in Austalia. I am dog person, and enjoy a wide varriety of Commedy and board games.
