As far as coding goes I am more at home with R than other languages. These are somes notes about basic Python syntax to help keep my head straight

# Python syntax notes

```
# Comments are preceded by #, yay

# Assignment uses =
res = 5

# Returns and coersion are explicit
print(res)
print("the result is ", str(res))

# Lists use single brackets [], indexed at 0, inclusive start, and exculsive end.
ls = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(ls[1:4])
#> 2, 3, 4

# Boolean are `True` and `False`, case sensitive, and equivalant to 1 and 0.
```
