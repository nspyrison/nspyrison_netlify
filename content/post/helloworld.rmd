# Gist

Blogdown accepts .md or .rmd files, write as though it's any other .rmd file. links are made with `[txt](link)` and images are made with `![hover_txt](img)`. Keep in mind the [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) and your favorite .rmd settings.

Remember to store `static` files like images and data in `./static/` (ie. `./static/MyFolder/Pic1.png`) and reference them from relative to the stat folder`![My picture](/MyFolder/Pic1.png)`.

However, data is stored and referneced as any other .rmd. (ie `./content/posts/data/df.rda`) is called with `load("./data/df.rda")`.


## R code

Blogdown runs R chunks as any R markdown would:

```{r}
"hello world, now in an `R` chunk!"

head(mtcars)
```

## Referencing images and data

Navigating images is handled differently than .rmd's, while loading data is handled the same. Dr. Navarro has a long post about this [here](https://djnavarro.net/post/starting-blogdown/). In short, here are a few working examples. If you need help getting started, you can check the the `\static\helloworld` and `\content\posts\helloworld` on my [github repo](https://github.com/nspyrison/nspyrison_netlify).

```{r}
load("./helloworld/df.rda")
